I am a PhD student at Ludwig Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, supervised by prof Hinrich Schuetze. My research is in natural language processing and machine learning.

My research focus is on various aspects of multilingual models, including their cross-lingual transferability capability and their applications. I am also interested in parameter-efficient methods, and low-resource learning.
